# Idea here is that a lot of heterogeneous graph datasets seem to have a general pattern for types
# There is one or more producer types (such as author, publisher, manufacturer, etc.)
# There is one or more item types (such as something to buy, a book, a paper, etc)
# This is a bit more questionable, but there can be a consumer type, maybe, for example someone that buys an item
# Oftentimes its link prediction, but we will focus on node prediction
# The prediction is something like a categorization of something
# It can be genre for a book
# It maybe is like grouping people into different classes that are likely to buy similar stuff, maybe idk

# So how do we construct an idealized "synthetic" version of such a dataset?
# will need to think even more about this, but I think this is finally a direction for a synthetic dataset that may actually work.
