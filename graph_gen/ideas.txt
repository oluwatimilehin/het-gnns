We can do graph values and/or graph structure

One thing we can do with graph structure is just count neighbors, and do something with that

I feel like everything I think here is like defining regression to the mean and shit
How the hell can graph neural networks even work it seems like a terrible idea that, well, fundamentally oversquashes


Maybe we can do r-regular for small r
Then we regress less.
For features we can do something like one hot encoding or something and have a matrix from there to R^5, not entirely sure tbh


Here is a dumbass idea:
have r-regular heterogeneous graph
just emulate an approximate distribution of the mean of the node values that are neighbors
Where each node is split into like self values and transmit values

to me there seem to be lots of essentially probabilistic ways where like maybe you pay attention to neighbors some of the time
But then that's sus I mean maybe its one possibility.


An alternate idea is to have it be deterministic but make the importance like an apriori probability rather than a factor directly
Where we try to optimize the constants
Basically each node mapped to some probability distribution
And we tune importance to do something like follow average of neighbors half the time or something.
